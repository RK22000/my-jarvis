## Overview

This document outlines the phased approach for developing the AI system, as discussed in July 2025. The goal is to incrementally build a robust, extensible AI assistant that can augment daily workflows.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure & Basic Agent

1. **Figure out a hosting solution**
   - Choose a simple cloud VM or managed service (e.g., Heroku, Render, Railway) for rapid prototyping.

2. **Create a secure I/O channel to the hosted solution**
   - Implement a secure communication channel between client(s) and server.
   - Initially, deploy an echo bot to test connectivity, latency, and reliability.

3. **Replace echo bot with a simple AI agent**
   - Start with a rule-based or retrieval-based agent for basic interactions.

## Phase 2: Data Store & Client Apps

4. **Implement the data store tool**
   - Build a modular, editable key-value store (file-based or database-backed).
   - Ensure CRUD operations and easy integration with the agent.

5. **Refine client UI**
   - Develop both mobile and desktop apps for user interaction.
   - Consider cross-platform frameworks (Flutter, React Native, Tauri, Electron) for rapid development.

6. **Set up STT (Speech-to-Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) on client apps (optional)**
   - Integrate as plugins or optional features to enhance accessibility.

## Phase 3: Coding Agent & Self-Improvement

7. **Set up the coding agent system**
   - Enable the agent to perform file manipulations and basic code generation/refactoring.
   - Gradually increase the agent's intelligence and autonomy.

8. **Enable self-improvement**
   - Aim for the system to assist in its own development, reducing manual intervention over time.

## Notes & Suggestions

- **Security:** Prioritize secure communication from the start.
- **Modularity:** Design components to be easily swappable or upgradable.
- **User Stories:** Expand with concrete examples as the system matures.
- **Monitoring:** Add basic logging/monitoring early for transparency and debugging.
- **Documentation:** Keep this plan updated as development progresses.
